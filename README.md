<B> Wind Speed Prediction Using VAE-S2S-BiLSTM-Enc-Dec and Streamlit </B>
<B> Objective </B>
This project aims to predict the wind speed for the next 5 days using a deep learning approach that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a sequence-to-sequence Bidirectional LSTM  Encoder-decoder (VAE-S2S-BiLSTM-Enc-Dec) network. The final solution is wrapped into an interactive, user-friendly web application using Streamlit.

<B>1. Data Preparation </B>

<B> Dataset: </B> DailyBeijingClimate.csv, containing historical weather records with features: meantemp, humidity, wind_speed, meanpressure.
- Converted date to datetime and set it as index.
- Selected relevant features and applied MinMaxScaler for normalization.
- Created time sequences using a sliding window with:
  
  ‚Ä¢ n_past = 10 (past days used for input)
  
  ‚Ä¢ n_future = 5 (days predicted)
  
- Split data into training and test sets (80:20).

<B> 2. Training and Evaluation </B>

- Trained the model for 200 epochs with batch size 16.
- Evaluation metrics included: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R¬≤, and Normalized MSE.
- Scalers for each feature were saved using joblib for consistent inference.

<B>  Deployment: Interactive Streamlit App </B>
An interactive web dashboard was built using Streamlit for real-time wind speed forecasting.
Key Features:
- Accepts user input for today‚Äôs weather (meantemp, humidity, wind_speed, meanpressure).
- Applies trained scalers and model inference.
- Displays:
  
  ‚Ä¢ Predicted wind speed for the next 5 days
  
  ‚Ä¢ Weather-level icons (üçÉ, üå¨Ô∏è, üå™Ô∏è)
  
  ‚Ä¢ Average wind speed visual indicator
  
- Uses custom CSS styling (glassmorphism, gradients, hover effects) for a polished UI.
- Supports session state to persist predictions.
- Ready for deployment or local use.
  
<B>  3. Results </B>  
- The app successfully integrates a real, trained deep learning model, not random predictions.
- The system generalizes well to unseen inputs and offers predictions in a user-friendly and visually rich format.
- The entire pipeline ‚Äî from data preprocessing to model inference to web visualization ‚Äî is automated and reusable.
